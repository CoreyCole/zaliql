This is BibTeX, Version 0.99dThe top-level auxiliary file: paper.aux
I couldn't open style file ACM-Reference-Format.bst
---line 42 of file paper.aux
 : \bibstyle{ACM-Reference-Format
 :                               }
I'm skipping whatever remains of this command
I found no style file---while reading file paper.aux
(There were 2 error messages)
